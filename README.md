# HMD-Fusion-DIY-Cases
A repo for storing my progress into developing a case/outift for the HMD Fusion phone. 

## Basic Start
### The breakout board

The breakout board is used to breakout the 6 pin header on the back of the phone and expand it into the ISO standard 2.54mm/0.1" 6 pin header for breadboard testing and development of circuits. 

This board should be manufactured using a flexible PCB material, the case and basic funcationality of the spring pins were designed with this in mind.

There is a testbench case to go with this, it is best printed in TPU or other flexible materials to ensure the spring loaded pins on the breakout board do not get bent or damaged when removing the phone from the case.
